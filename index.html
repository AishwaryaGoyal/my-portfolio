            Hey there! I am Aishwarya/ Aurora. I love working in all mediums
            like watercolors, oil paints, acrylics, pencil colors, plain pencil
            or pen. I have been painting for 5 long years and I just love my
            work. Painting is like meditation and recreation for me. I like to
            delve deep into the intricacies and make realistic drawings, as much
            as I do simple cartoonish characters. Nowadays I am drawing more on
            the side of cartoons, kawaii and chibi. Take some time and explore
            my site to know more about me and my works.

          This is a painting of mine which is very close to my heart. I gave in
          all my skills and hardwork into it to make it as special as it is. A
          child sitting by a river, watching her hands and her reflection in
          water. I found the reference image as a photograph on pinterest and
          decided to convert it into painting. Main reasons behind my choice of
          reference were- I wanted to paint a subject which would be universal,
          which gives good feels to anyone, old or young, big or small when he
          sees it, and another reason that whatever it is I wanted that I donot
          get bored while making it. So yes, 1.5 months that I gave in to this
          work, I was totally involved in it, it kept my spirits up all the
          time. Its been 3 years since I made this painting. And all these years
          people have adored it.
          <p>
            This painting is made in oil colors. Its canvas size is 2 by 2.5 ft.
            It took me an average of 64 hours to make it. Reference photography

          I made this painting in the end of 2019. I call it "Beyond" due to its
          celestial theme. I have used the astrological elements of the Cancerian
          horoscope- moon and water. Along with that I have included some mountains
          and clouds. The girl in the picture is coming out of the waves taking form
          of water itself. Girl's reference is taken from pinterest. It took me
          1 month to complete this painting. I worked during the weekdays for
          2 hours every day on an average. This painting is completely made using
          oil colors. This is a video attached on the side that you see here.
          Go ahead and play it to get a zoomed-in view of the painting. The unframed
          size of this painting is 2*2.5 feet.

          Still another oil painting of mine which is again my favourite. 
          A bicycle's basket full of flowers. Always loved the whole idea 
          of this thing. I made this painting for spring festival, flowers
          blooming. You can tell from this how much I love riding bicycles.

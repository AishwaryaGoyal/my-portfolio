            Hey there! I am Aishwarya/ Aurora. I love working in all mediums
            like watercolors, oil paints, acrylics, pencil colors, plain pencil
            or pen. I have been painting for 5 long years and I just love my
            work. Painting is like meditation and recreation for me. I like to
            delve deep into the intricacies and make realistic drawings, as much
            as I do simple cartoonish characters. Nowadays I am drawing more on
            the side of cartoons, kawaii and chibi. Take some time and explore
            my site to know more about me and my works.

          This is a painting of mine which is very close to my heart. I gave in
          all my skills and hardwork into it to make it as special as it is. A
          child sitting by a river, watching her hands and her reflection in
          water. I found the reference image as a photograph on pinterest and
          decided to convert it into painting. Main reasons behind my choice of
          reference were- I wanted to paint a subject which would be universal,
          which gives good feels to anyone, old or young, big or small when he
          sees it, and another reason that whatever it is I wanted that I donot
          get bored while making it. So yes, 1.5 months that I gave in to this
          work, I was totally involved in it, it kept my spirits up all the
          time. Its been 3 years since I made this painting. And all these years
          people have adored it.
          <p>
            This painting is made in oil colors. Its canvas size is 2 by 2.5 ft.
            It took me an average of 64 hours to make it.
